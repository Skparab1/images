# images
a website for my photographs
- can be searched for on my [search page](https://skparab1.github.io/search) (to be implemented)
  - probably not render photos 
    - would take too much time to load
  - maybe thumbnails using a large image cropped
  - probably just subtitles or captions or image titles
  - and the preset conditions should be img=false
  - if the user enables it then we can pack &img=true into the url
  - hmmmm If the user is searching just images, then maybe display the thumbnails
  - because the images website would be like "search for an image" and it would take you to the search page with &img=true&software=false&webpage=false&article=false
  - and if the thumbnails didn't show and only the captions/titiles then it wouldnt be easy to find an image
  

- issue with object order
- text is displayed before images
- trying figcaption with all images
  - doesnt seem to work 
  - the order of objects is off
  - tried figcaption but doesnt work (only indents)
  - text is still displayed before images
  - tried using html canvas with js graphics
  - doesn't work shows blank screen
